FAQ Section – Frontend Mini Project

By Chaitanya Sharma
📌 Project Description

This is a responsive and visually appealing FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section designed using HTML5 and CSS3. It features an elegant gradient background, clean card-based layout, and collapsible answers for a smooth user experience. Font Awesome icons are used to enhance interactivity.

This project was created as part of my frontend development learning journey. It demonstrates my understanding of layout design, user interface structuring, and styling fundamentals in modern web development.

During the development of this FAQ section, I focused on:

    ✅ Applying advanced CSS techniques like gradients, shadows, and flexbox
